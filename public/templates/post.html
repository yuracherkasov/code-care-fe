        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
        will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
        truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
        pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
        extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
        pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain
        some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has
        no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we
        denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
        pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee

        The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music,
        sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and
        their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay
        expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more
        common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular
        than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing
        European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it
        will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is.The

        A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy
        with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss
        of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
        existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
        and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour
        around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few
        stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;
        and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the
        little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and
        flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath
